                <h3>Using AI Methods to Unfold Detector Effects from Ratios
                    Observables Obtained from High Energy Particle Collision Data</h3>
                <p class="text1">
                    Unfolding is a critical computational technique in experimental physics, as it 
                    gives insight into the true characteristics of data that have been altered 
                    through measurement. In the context of high-energy particle collisions, 
                    fundamental particle phenomenology is modeled by probability density functions 
                    (pdf) for various underlying physical quantities such as the momentum and energy 
                    of final-state particles, which are testing aspects of the Standard Model of 
                    Particle physics, the theory that describes particles at the smallest distance 
                    ever probed by human means. In particular interest to the Large Hadron Collider
                     (LHC), the premier high-energy physics facility in the world, is uncovering the
                      theory of the strong interaction, which is responsible for the process of proton 
                      collision, several fundamental processes, and production of final-state particles.
                       However, to observe probability functions predicted by QCD and measurable effects, 
                       it is necessary to use detectors that can distort these pdfs and quantities through
                        subtle interactions. Unfolding techniques allow us to use models of these detector 
                        effects by simulating the complex instrumentation used for detection to ultimately 
                        make inference about underlying pdfs that could be compared to theoretical predictions.
                         To construct unfolding methods of significant interest for testing the theory of 
                         QCD at hadron collider is the measurement of ratio observables as theyâ€™re significantly
                          more precise than absolute measurements by exploiting positive correlations between 
                      systematic uncertainties to mitigate them. Subsequently, the ratios are sensitive to
                       differences in any given QCD effects between processes because of the correlation between
                        processes. They are therefore ideal for fine-tuning modeling issues that are difficult 
                        to study in an absolute cross-section measurement. The problem with ratio measurements 
                        is that we do not know how to unfold them because there is no event migration between 
                        bins of an observable ratio. Unfolding would then have to be done separately between the numerator 
                        and the denominator, which breaks some of the correlations that are exploited in ratio measurements.
                         A bin-by-bin correction to a ratio would assume that there is no correlation between bins of an observable, 
                         which is not accurate. The Tufts ATLAS group has recently developed an object-based event-by-event unfolding 
                         algorithm using Conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (cDDPM)(Pazos et al.). The 
                         objective of this project is to use this algorithm to demonstrate that the ratio of observables 
                         can be unfolded, and by comparing standard methods with our diffusion model unfolding, we show 
                         the upsides of our method.

                <h2>Non-invasive method for Analyzing Brain Structure in Neurodegenerative Diseases</h2>
                <p class="text1">
                    The goal of this project was to create a non-invasive method to analyze the neural structure of the brain.
                    Since the brain is the most essential part of the human anatomy, its crucial we understands its strcutre.
                    Specifically, neurodegenerative diseases affect several millions world wide, so we are building a method 
                    that can identify early signs of neurodegenerative diseases. By identifying it early, we can save many people,
                    some of which may have not even known they were at risk. Using the fact that the brain is composed 75 percent of 
                    water, we look at the diffusion of water particles inside of the brain. Since the presence of a neurodegenerative 
                    disease would affect axons, as they would begin to "bead", we can search for any patterns in the diffusion that 
                    would reflect geometrical changes in the axon. This project started with the MIT think competition and creating 
                    an axon simulation where the axons were rectangular prisms and the beaded axons were just larger rectangles. Now we
                    have worked with MGH to analyze real axon data and use our algorithm to analyze the diffusion patterns among both 
                    normal and beaded axons. We hope this research can lead to better health technqiues that will directly support
                    those who are at rist for neurodegenerative diseases. I personally have had family affected by neurodegenerative diseases
                    and I want to make a better and safer world for people like them.

                <h2>Single Particle Diffusion on Templated Surfaces</h2>
                <p class="text1">
                    The goal of this project was to understand the mechanism of colloidal crystal growth, specifically in regards to a
                    previous project where we observed different rates of growth for two identical materials of different orientations.
                    Colloids are important materials for understanding particle interactions as they are large enough to accurately observe 
                    under quality microscopes, but also obey properties of much smaller particles. Specifically, we were interested in
                    the diffusion of particles along the surface of a crystal. While building a clean monolayer of crystal is a relatively
                    difficult, we had access to extremely-fine templates that copied the structure of a FCC crystal. For my project, we had
                    to dilute a silica solution until it was thin enough to ensure no particles would interact with any other. Then, we 
                    imaged the particles diffusing on the template at more than 100 frames per second, and created software to track particles
                    and their trajectory over the imaging duration. At these high framerates, we could calculate both diffusion with small 
                    and large steps, which gave us insight into how often each particle moved between each crystal section. From there, we 
                    calculated the diffusion coefficient and other metrics that showed up characteristics of the particle movement. Comparing
                    the particle diffusions on different templates supported our findings in the previous project. It was fruitful work to
                    see the time and effort I had put into this project as a whole ended with a thorough explanation of our observations.

                <h2>Identification of Crystals in Liquid to Solid Transition</h2>
                <p class="text1">
                    The goal of this project was to develop techniques to identify crystal growth in 
                    the transition between liquid to solid phases. Clasically, there are several methods
                    available to identify crystals, such as Q6 and topology methods. These methods mostly
                    include using a particle's distance to each of its neighboring particles to identify 
                    crystal-like particles. These methods are important and work effeciently in many systems,
                    but we were looking to identify crystal structures formed during the transition between liquid
                    and solid structures. To complete this, we looked at each particles Voronoi structure. <br>
                    <br>
                    A Voronoi Cell by definition is the space closest to a particle more so than any other neighboring particle.
                    Given a system of colloidal particles in a 3D space, this results in a polyhedral structure. With this 
                    polyhedral, we looked at many of its characteristics using a visualization software, Ovito Pro, and 
                    creating python scripts that would allow us to calculate bond angles and face degrees to identify crystal structures.
                    Comparing to other methods, both visually and raw data, we saw similarities between previous identification 
                    methods and ours, and we could identify many cases where small pockets of crystal-like structures were
                    identified during the phase transition.

                <h2>Differential growth in a Colloidal System</h2>
                <p class="text1">
                    The goal of this project, in the summer of 2023, was to
                    use colloidal systems to understand crystal structures, specifically looking
                    FCC crystals and their structure at boundaries. Our basic philosophy was relatively
                    simple: to identify whether two crystals would grow at different rates. Given two crystals
                    growing adjacently, the boundary between the crystals will begin to "tilt" towards the higher
                    density crystal as it will take less volume than the other. Thus, it makes sense for two crystals
                    of different density to have this "tilt" at the boundary, so we looked at whether an identical crystal
                    at a different orientation would cause any differential growth.
                    While it would be most obvious for two crystals of the same density to grow at the same rate, we observed 
                    that varying the orientation between two identical crystals, we noticed a tilt at the boundary, indicating 
                    that the growth between the crystals is different. We had several more trials, all of which had similar 
                    results, where the tilt of the boundary was between 51-56 degrees relative to the xy-plane. We presume 
                    there is some interaction between the particles at the boundary where the high layer density of one orientation 
                    causes particles to shift to the higher density since particles will always try to pack closely.

                <p class="text1">
                    The goal of this project was to create an web application that focused on task management with the 
                    special feature of connecting and overlaying a personal google calendar. The home page of this webstie acts
                    as the hub of all the elements as both calendar page elements and TODO list elements are shown. The calendar page
                    uses the google calendar API to create a TaskBird calendar/check if a TaskBird Calendar exists in your personal
                    account and then gives you options to view, add, or delete events on any sepcififed day. The TODO page gives a simple 
                    list that allows the user to create an event/task to complete with a certain level of urgency. This list is 
                    ordered by the specified urgency and once a task is completed, you have an identical list below with the completed 
                    tasks. Using the browser cookies, I have all the tasks, both in the TODO list and completed list, saved within the
                    browser memory, which can be easily cleared with a given button. For the home page, we use this saved memory 
                    to overlay all the tasks in the TODO list into a simple block. Additionally, we simply accessed the google calendar
                    again and let the user view it through the home page, but not give the options for edits. The last part of the
                    website is a template for a future feature, where users will be able to either post their own profile for
                    advertising professional level skills and other users can contact these "professionals" to learn their skills
                    for a specific price.

                <h2>Understanding affinity between condensates and probe particles</h2>
                <p class="text1">
                    It's commonly believed that most crucial aspects within cells are determined through an organized 
                    system of lipid bilayer covered organelles, such as the nucleus mitochondria, and endoplasmic reticulum,
                    and the rest of the cell is filled with cytoplasm and unordered proteins. However, recent discoveries
                    and insight suggest that membraneless organelles known as biomolecular condensates play a much bigger 
                    role within cells. My research was focused on understanding how probe particles interact with the condensate 
                    boundary, specifically how adding a polymer layer to the probe particle or adjusting the size of the probe particle
                    could impact the particle's ability to penetrate the condensate boundary. We used polyadenylic acid RNA (PolyA) for the basis of our condensate,
                    which is a string of RNA with a chain of adenine nucleotides attached to the end. Additionally, we attached 
                    polyethylene glycol (PEG) particles, which act as a crowding agent inside of the condensate, changing its formation.
                    For the probe particles, we used a neutral particle coated in PEG, with the theory that by coating the probe particle
                    in the same material as the crowding agent inside of the condensate, it would have a higher probability of moving 
                    inside of the condensate. Over the ten weeks, I was given the opportunity to present my research at the REU
                    poster session and present to my entire lab. It was an invaluable first experience in the research field and
                    fueled my motivation to pursue research as a career.

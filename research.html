            <h3>Identification of Crystals in Liquid to Solid Transition</h3>
            <br>
            <p class="text1">
                The goal of this project was to develop techniques to identify crystal growth in 
                the transition between liquid to solid phases. Clasically, there are several methods
                available to identify crystals, such as Q6 and topology methods. These methods mostly
                include using a particle's distance to each of its neighboring particles to identify 
                crystal-like particles. These methods are important and work effeciently in many systems,
                but we were looking to identify crystal structures formed during the transition between liquid
                and solid structures. To complete this, we looked at each particles Voronoi structure. <br>
                <br>
                A Voronoi Cell by definition is the space closest to a particle more so than any other neighboring particle.
                Given a system of colloidal particles in a 3D space, this results in a polyhedral structure. With this 
                polyhedral, we looked at many of its characteristics using a visualization software, Ovito Pro, and 
                creating python scripts that would allow us to calculate bond angles and face degrees to identify crystal structures.
                Comparing to other methods, both visually and raw data, we saw similarities between previous identification 
                methods and ours, and we could identify many cases where small pockets of crystal-like structures were
                identified during the phase transition.

            <h3>Differential growth in a Colloidal System</h3>
            <br>
            <p class="text1">
                The goal of this project, in the summer of 2023, was to
                use colloidal systems to understand crystal structures, specifically looking
                FCC crystals and their structure at boundaries. Our basic philosophy was relatively
                simple: to identify whether two crystals would grow at different rates. Given two crystals
                growing adjacently, the boundary between the crystals will begin to "tilt" towards the higher
                density crystal as it will take less volume than the other. Thus, it makes sense for two crystals
                of different density to have this "tilt" at the boundary, so we looked at whether an identical crystal
                at a different orientation would cause any differential growth.<br>
                <br>
                While it would be most obvious for two crystals of the same density to grow at the same rate, we observed 
                that varying the orientation between two identical crystals, we noticed a tilt at the boundary, indicating 
                that the growth between the crystals is different. We had several more trials, all of which had similar 
                results, where the tilt of the boundary was between 51-56 degrees relative to the xy-plane. We presume 
                there is some interaction between the particles at the boundary where the high layer density of one orientation 
                causes particles to shift to the higher density since particles will always try to pack closely.

            <h3>TaskBird, a task management web application</h3>
            <br>
            <p class="text1">
                The goal of this project was to create an web application that focused on task management with the 
                special feature of connecting and overlaying a personal google calendar. The home page of this webstie acts
                as the hub of all the elements as both calendar page elements and TODO list elements are shown. The calendar page
                uses the google calendar API to create a TaskBird calendar/check if a TaskBird Calendar exists in your personal
                account and then gives you options to view, add, or delete events on any sepcififed day. The TODO page gives a simple 
                list that allows the user to create an event/task to complete with a certain level of urgency. This list is 
                ordered by the specified urgency and once a task is completed, you have an identical list below with the completed 
                tasks. Using the browser cookies, I have all the tasks, both in the TODO list and completed list, saved within the
                browser memory, which can be easily cleared with a given button. For the home page, we use this saved memory 
                to overlay all the tasks in the TODO list into a simple block. Additionally, we simply accessed the google calendar
                again and let the user view it through the home page, but not give the options for edits. The last part of the
                website is a template for a future feature, where users will be able to either post their own profile for
                advertising professional level skills and other users can contact these "professionals" to learn their skills
                for a specific price.

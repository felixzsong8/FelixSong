This page is to give you an idea of who I am as a person and highlight my personal achievements and experiences. Throughout my time in k-12 and college, I have met many people, been through trials and tribulations, all of which culminate in who I am today and will continue to build on who I will be in the future.

Those who read this I hope my story interests you and if you would like to reach out:

                <p> Hi, I'm Felix Song
                    <br> <br>
                    I was born in Ridgefield Connecticut, but I've grown up mostly in Newton Massachusettes, where
                    my family and I currently reside. As a child, I was always curious about nature and science, 
                    influenced by my parents who both aquired PhDs in STEM fields.
                    <br><br>
                    Throughout my K-12 education, I've always been interested in pursuing a career in STEM. Not only
                    do I beleive that understanding the natural laws of the universe give one insight in almost
                    all walks of life, but to simplify the complexities of life was fun. As a kid, we take a lot for granted
                    and we don't bother to understand many phenomena. Speeding up as you sled down a hill, why your arm gets red around a scratch
                    or why hot chocolate feels so good in the winter snow. All of the these random happening can be explained Through
                    science and as a grew older, I felt more and more inclined to know the "why" to everything. 
                    <br><br>
                    Outside of academics, I have several hobbies that I have given me meaningful experiences that help me
                    connect to others and share persepctive. I loved atheltics as a kid and still to this day as I feel its 
                    just as important to maintain good health as it is to grow our knowledge to fulfill our dreams and aspirations.
                    From the ages of seven to seventeen, I swam on a local YMCA and Club team (Charles River Aquatics), 
                    competing in both local and USA meets. While it was time consuming, painful, and stressful at times,
                    I wouldn't be the person who I am today as overcoming the many difficulties that came with swimming made
                    me stronger and more disiplined as a person. This culminated in high school where I was given the oppurtunity to
                    be captain of my swim team and lead us to our best palcement in the state championship meet that we had

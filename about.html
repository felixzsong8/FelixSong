                <p> 
                    I was born in Connecticut, but I've grown up mostly in Boston, Massachusetts. As a child, 
                    I was always curious about nature and science, influenced by my parents who both acquired PhDs in STEM fields.
                    <br><br>
                    Throughout my K-12 education, I've always been interested in pursuing a career in STEM. Not only
                    do I believe that understanding the natural laws of the universe give one insight in almost
                    all walks of life, but to simplify the complexities of life was fun. As a kid, we take a lot for granted
                    and we don't bother to understand many phenomena. Speeding up as you sled down a hill, why your arm gets red around a scratch
                    or why hot chocolate feels so good in the winter snow. All of the these random happenings can be explained through
                    science and as I grew older, I felt more and more inclined to know the "why" to everything. 
                    <br><br>
                    Through high school, I found myself gravitating towards science as both the subject itself and the
                    people involved in the field interested me. Watching Bill Nye seemingly control lightning like a superhero
                    seemed like the obvious person to look up to. In chemistry, we mixed different materials to produce a wide 
                    variety of fun reactions, like green flames or viscous liquids. In biology, we went on trips into the forest
                    to look at different plant life and how our ecosystem operated, both on a macroscopic and microscopic level.
                    However, I was most interested in physics, where we made toy cars and sent them down ramps to learn 
                    about velocity and friction.

                    For the past four years, I've been attending Tufts University, majoring in Physics with minors in 
                    Mathematics and Computer Science. In my experience, the support and high quality of education
                    at Tufts has produced a skill set with real-world applications. In the first two years of my
                    undergraduate education, I filled my class schedule with several foundational and high level
                    physics and math courses, spanning from Quantum physics to relativistic E&M and multivariable calculus to
                    mathematical data analysis. As I continued my studies, I realized the important role that computers
                    have and will play in our development of science, so I decided to additionally pursue a minor in 
                    computer science. In that time, I've learned how computers are utilized in experimental physics and
                    data science, two fields I would love to pursue in the future. As a capstone project, I completed a 
                    Senior Thesis advised by Prof. Beauchemin titled "Using AI Methods to Unfold Detector Effects from Ratio
                    Observables Obtained from High Energy Particle Collision Data". This project taught me so much about the
                    whole process of research and continues to be my motivation to pursue a career in research.

        <h2>Research Experience</h2>
        <div class="box box-left">
            <div class="box-content">
                <p>
                    In the summer of 2021 after I graduated high school, I connected with a graduate student, Zsolt Terdik, 
                    to learn how the process of research worked. Since I was a high school student, he knew that I would have
                    to learn from the ground up. Focusing on foundational skills, I researched lots of physics and mathematical
                    theory, ranging from fourier transforms to monte carlo systems. After that, Zsolt gave me a project to understand
                    and implement a denoising algorithm into our lab computer to use for future analysis. I was able to successfully 
                    implement in on my own mac computer so I thought it would be no problem on the lab computer. Subsequently, I spent
                    50 hours of my summer vacation in the lab trying to figure out a linux system. At the end of my summer, I was still
                    unsuccessful in a finished installation as my unexperience in linux systems and fear of damaging the computer kept 
                    me from completing my first project. While I spent some time dissapointed in myself, I look back on that experience
                    and I am thankful I failed. It put a burning passion in me to strive for success and look at problems from many
                    different persepctives, and I continued to uphold these values in my future project.
                    <br><br>
                    In the summer of 2022, I was selected for the Harvard 2022 Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) 
                    program at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS). The SEAS REU program was a 10-week program built
                    for inquisitive students to learn and develop research skills, guided by some of the brightest minds in America. 
                    I was fortunate to work in both the Weitz Lab and Spaepen Lab, which focused on the physical properties of 
                    a diverse set of materials, from cell structure to crystal lattices. I chose a project centered around 
                    biomolecular condensates, a biological structure that act as compartment in several cellular process. Given it was
                    my first experience in a wetlab research setting, it had to tackle several new challenges and a fair share of setbacks.
                    We were researching the best method to implement microrheology on our condensates, using particle movements to map the structure of
                    condensates, as previous methods were invasive. We used a polymer coating and varied the size of the probing 
                    particles to see whether the probing particle could penetrate the outside layer of the condensate through
                    purely non-human mechanical action. Through my ten week experience, I was able to learn not only how to conduct research,
                    but also how to document research, which I realized was nearly just as important. 
                    <br><br>
                    In the summer of 2023, I was excited to return to the REU SEAS program and build on the skills I had 
                    learned in the previous summer. My new project was centered around crystal structure and epitaxy. 
                    Its understandable that two crystals of different density would grow at different rates under the same forces
                    and the same flux of crystal particles. However, what we were interested in was how two crystals of the same
                    density but differing orientation would grow adjacent to each other. In this process, growing crystals 
                    under gravitational force took several hours, so it became crucial for me to plan my time and experiments 
                    efficiently. We found that one crystal orientation consistently grew faster than the other, and I presented
                    these findings at the 97th New England Complex Fluids Conference. I additionally did another project on 
                    computational methods for identification of crystal structures, specifically looking for small crystal structures
                    appearing during phase transitions. Using the geometry of the Voronoi Cell surrounding each crystal particle,
                    we were able to create a working algorithm that could identify clusters of crystal particles. 
                    <br><br>
                    In the summer of 2024, I wanted to continue my previous summer's research and participate in other research involving 
                    computational physics in biological systems. In regards to the crystal research project, I pushed to understand
                    what was the mechanism behind the differential growth rates as it had been unclear to why our findings were such.
                    We analyzed single particle diffusion on different templated surfaces to emulate crystal growth on crystal faces. Then,
                    using particle tracking techniques and analyzing the diffusion of all particles, we saw clear differences on
                    the diffusion rates for each template. Discussing and learning from my mentor and other PhD students in the lab
                    was tremendous for my interest and desire to continue research. To these ends, I also pursued a project centering around 
                    developing a non-invasive technique for mapping the structure of the brain. Specifically observing the brownian motion
                    of a water particle in the brain to analyze each axon. This started with simple simulated axons and moved to 
                    working with real sample data provided by MGH and more complex simulations. I believe that physics, in tandem with 
                    computational power, can have an amazing impact on our society and I would love to be at the forefront of that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most recently, I completed a training rotation at Genomes2People, focusing on learning foundational
                    skills relevent in genomics and medicine. This included going through courses, researching genetic disease
                    trials and interventions, and reading peer-reviewed papers exploring developments in genomic analytics and
                    return of results. Throughout the training, I was fortunate to attend several conferences where I learned
                    about the most recent developments in genomic medicine, and I was able to make great connections with 
                    bright minds in the field.

        <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
        <div class="box box-right">
            <div class="box-content">
                <p>
                    Outside of academics, I have several hobbies that I have given me meaningful experiences, helping me
                    connect to others and share perspectives. I loved athletics as a kid and to this day, as I feel its 
                    just as important to maintain good health as it is to grow our knowledge to fulfill our dreams and aspirations.
                    From the ages of seven to seventeen, I swam on a local YMCA and Club team (Charles River Aquatics), 
                    competing in both local and USA meets. While it was time consuming, painful, and stressful at times,
                    I wouldn't be the person who I am today as overcoming the many difficulties that came with swimming made
                    me stronger and more disciplined as a person. This culminated in high school where I was given the opportunity to
                    be captain of my swim team and lead us to our best placement in the state championship meet that we had in our school's
                    history - or at least as far back as anyone could remember. After high school, I felt as though I had given swimming
                    all I could, so I switched to the polar opposite sport, volleyball. Filled with teamwork, communication, much less cardio,
                    and more pain on the knees, I began to love this new sport. For my freshman year of university, I played nearly everyday, 
                    making life long friends in the process. In line with my interest, I quickly was able to join the club volleyball team 
                    where I have been a part of for the last four years. Playing volleyball has given me some of the greatest and most exhilarating
                    moments in my life, but it hasn't come without its costs. I've dealt with recurring knee issues and I've had to learn
                    how to properly take care of myself, which sometimes includes time away from the sport I love. Sports have taught me
                    plenty of life lessons and I hope to continue learning more for the rest of my life.
                    <br><br>
                    Another interest of mine is music. I grew playing the piano, but I soon found that practicing and memorizing
                    countless classic piano songs wasn't for me, so I soon quit. In fourth grade, I would then learn how to play 
                    the alto saxophone, an instrument that represented style and creativity. I would soon lean towards playing jazz as 
                    it aligned with my style of playing music and improv became my expression for that. I continued playing into high 
                    school where our school's jazz ensemble qualified for the Mingus Big Band competition and traveled to New York to
                    compete. In college, every spring I've played with some Jazz group, with the same interest in meeting new people
                    with a similar passion for music and developing my own skills. Throughout the years, I've also learned the basics
                    for guitar, ukulele, trumpet, flute, drums, and even some singing. 
                    <br><br> 
                    Some other hobbies of mine include: cooking, swimming, and learning new skills. My mom's cooking will always remain 
                    undefeated, but I think I emulate her cooking 
                    somewhat successfully. As a combination of making that I personally like to eat and saving money, cooking has become a
                    central part of my life. Similarly, swimming was such a big part of my life that every now and then, I love to 
                    hop back into the pool. Lastly, I think learning new skills, as a general statement, is an amazing thing. Whether its
                    learning how to juggle a soccer ball or learning where to invest in the stock market, I believe learning new skills
                    has broadened my perspective on several different facets of life.

                    I believe everyone should, in one way or another, give back to your community. Whether thats helping build new
                    real estate, providing food for those in need, or supporting local businesses, your community will always
                    be yours. I spent several years working with OptiNeeds, a non-profit organization centered around helping special needs
                    athletes by proving free prescription eyewear. We went to many different conferences and helped many athletes. I was
                    very meaningful to see how happy some of the athletes were with their new swim goggles. I've also needed prescription 
                    eyewear in the past and it was so helpful for me, so I understood the impact it had for them. This experience inspired me
                    to start my own non-profit, OmniTempo. I wanted to use skills that I had learned to help my community, so I based OmniTempo
                    around proving music, specifically jazz, to seniors who had either played music in the past or had never played before. 
                    Music has had such a big impact on my life and I knew other would feel the same. I performed and taught at senior homes and 
                    even online during the pandemic. Seeing the joy I could bring people simply through expressing my own interest in music
                    was a fantastic experience. Looking back, I hope my presense in my community uplifted and inspired poeple to pursue what they love.
